# SnakeGame
•	The objective of the game is to allow the snake to grow larger in size and maneuver the board without hitting the boundary or entangling itself.
•	This game has been built in Java with Java applet. The user can play manually or observe an AI mode where the snake plays itself.

The main file is SpampedeBrain.java.

To move the snake use the following keys:

"I" : up
"K" : down
"J" : left
"L: right

Use "A" for the AI mode that uses a BFS to find the shortest path to the next "food" piece for the snake to move.
